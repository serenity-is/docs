# Getting Started

The best and fastest way to get your hands dirty on Serenity is *SERENE*, which is a sample application template.

You have two options to install *SERENE* template into your Visual Studio:

* [Installing SERENE from Visual Studio Gallery](installing_serene_from_visual_studio_gallery.md)

* [Installing SERENE directly from Visual Studio](installing_serene_directly_from_visual_studio.md)

> You don't have to use this template to work with Serenity. You can add Serenity libraries to any .NET project with NuGet. 

> It is also possible to add Serenity as a GIT submodule to your project and keep it always up to date with sources. 

> We'll cover these and more in other chapters.
