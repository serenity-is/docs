# A Tour Of Serene Features

After logging to Serene, you are greeted with the dashboard page.

There is not much interesting content here yet, but you would choose to customize this page with some news, graphics etc.

There is an accordion navigation menu on left which has a search feature by input above it. We'll talk about how to customize items there in later sections.

On top navigation, we have a theme selection option to change active language and a dropdown displays current username.
